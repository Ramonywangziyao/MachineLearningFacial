# MachineLearningFacial
A Java program trained by data for facial recognition through pure TEXT

# Feature
<li>GUI to show the probability RGB map for pixels</li>
<li>High recognition rate</li>
<li>For research use. Can be applied to real facial recognition. Replace the text file with image, and modify the code (through adding features to not detect the ASCII characters but RGB color of a pixel on an image)</li>
<li>Play with it by pressing up/down key on keyboard to increase/decrease the amplifier for RGB color. See what happens</li>
GOOD LUCK!

#HOW TO RUN
<li>Run displayImageOdds.java. Wait the training ends and GUI program start</li>

#Environment
Java JDK http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html
